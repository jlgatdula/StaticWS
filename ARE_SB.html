						<h2>Synopsis</h2>
						<p>It all started in Kaminoyama High School, when five best friends - Aoi Miyamori, Ema Yasuhara, Midori Imai, Shizuka Sakaki, and Misa Toudou - discovered their collective love for all things anime and formed the animation club. After making their first amateur anime together and showcasing it at the culture festival, the group vow to pursue careers in the industry, aiming to one day work together and create their own mainstream show.<br>
						Two and a half years later, Aoi and Ema have managed to land jobs at the illustrious Musashino Animation production company. The others, however, are finding it difficult to get their dream jobs. Shizuka is feeling the weight of not being recognized as a capable voice actor, Misa has a secure yet unsatisfying career designing 3D models for a car company, and Midori is a university student intent on pursuing her dream as a story writer. These five girls will learn that the path to success is one with many diversions, but dreams can still be achieved through perseverance and a touch of eccentric creativity.<br>

						<h2>Review</h2>
						</header>
						<p>If I had to summarize this anime in a sentence, it would be "Anime production is never easy." This anime perfectly tells the story about a production company and its employees on their endeavors to provide quality anime with limited budget. The animation is simple and doesn't hurt the viewers' eyes with vibrant colors. Sounds were also of great quality. Character development doesn't only focus on the five main characters but also on their colleagues and their respective responsbilities in making quality anime.<br>
						Lessons such as never giving up and creativity are very apparent in this series. Working hard and smart yields results just like in the real world.</p>
